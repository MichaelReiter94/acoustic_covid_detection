The template also provides several commands that make life easier. The ``reminder'' commands, for example, can be used to \reminder{mark something that should be revised}, but also as a placeholder for leftout parts of a \rem, if there is some open question \remq, or you have to look up some reference \remc. They can easily be found in the source code: Just search for \verb|\rem|. A second group of commands is used to create nice value-unit pairs, such as \vu{f=3}{kHz}, \vuc{2}{\textmu V}{\pm1}, or \vum{T\leq735}{\textdegree}{\pm4}. Feel free to redefine them to your needs.
